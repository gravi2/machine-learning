# About
This repository contains some of my Machine Learning Projects. These projects were done as part of Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree (DLND) Program (https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). The Nano Degree covered an indeepth understanding of deep learning neural networks and hands-on implementation using PyTorch, Numpy & Pandas to name a few.    

# DLND Projects
1. [Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns](./bike-sharing/)
2. [Dog Breed Classifier](./project-dog-classification/)
3. [Seinfeld TV Script Generator](./seinfeld-tv-script-generation/)
4. [Generate Faces](./face-generation/)
5. Deployging Sentiment Analysis Model

# Environment
1. Its recommended to use Anaconda to manage your environment.
2. Make sure you have installed Anaconda, created a environment and activated it.
3. Install the usual basic things like git, so that you can checkout the project.
4. Then Install PyTorch and torchvision; this should install the latest version of PyTorch.
    - __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch 
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch -c pytorch
	pip install torchvision
	```

5. Install a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file (including OpenCV).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

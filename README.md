# About
This repository contains some of my Machine Learning Projects. These projects were done as part of Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree (DLND) Program (https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). The Nano Degree covered an indeepth understanding of deep learning neural networks and handson implmentation using PyTorch, Numpy to name a few.    

# DLND Projects
1. Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns
2. Dog Breed Classifier
3. Generate TV Scripts
4. Generate Faces
5. Deployging Sentiment Analysis Model
